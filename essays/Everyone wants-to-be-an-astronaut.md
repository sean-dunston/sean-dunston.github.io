## Early intrists 

Like a typical child, I had wild aspirations of what I wanted to be when I grew up, but at no point had I thought about doing software engineering.  Partly because I had never heard of software engineering let alone software, and partly because like many children, I wanted to be an astronaut.  Like most of those other children, I have realized that I will not become an astronaut.  What I mean by this is not that I have settled for a more attainable goal, but that what I want to do is not set.  

## Transformation

What I can say is that, I enjoy coding, and I have since I was in high school.  This is what ultimately lead me to become a computer science major and end up in a software engineering class.  I am simply pursuing not only something that I enjoy, but something I that will give me employable skills.  This leaves me in a weird spot because I donâ€™t even know for sure that I want to have a future in software engineering.  

## Where I am now

However, regardless of what I end up doing I would like to learn to use more languages so that I can use the best language for the situation and am capable of handling software regardless of the language it is written in.  In the closer future, I would love to be able to get an internship at a company where I can develop my skills and practice what I already know.
